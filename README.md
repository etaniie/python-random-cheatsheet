# 🐍 Python Random Cheatsheet

This repository contains my **personal Python cheatsheets** collected during my learning journey, organized as **Jupyter Notebooks**. The goal is to provide a **practical, example-driven, quick-reference resource** rather than a full tutorial.

The content starts with core Python concepts and gradually touches topics useful for **bioinformatics and computational biology**, including **Biopython**.

---

## 🎯 Target Audience

* Python beginners and early-intermediate learners
* People who prefer learning through **code examples**
* Users working with **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code / Colab**
* Students interested in **bioinformatics, data science, or scientific computing**

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each notebook focuses on a specific topic and can be used independently as a cheatsheet.

### 🧩 Core Python

* **cheatsheet_1.ipynb** – Python basics, variables, and simple operations
* **cheatsheet2.ipynb** – Strings and basic string manipulation
* **cheatsheet3.ipynb** – Lists, tuples, and sets
* **cheatsheet4.ipynb** – Dictionaries and key–value operations
* **cheatsheet5.ipynb** – Conditional statements and logical flow
* **cheatsheet6.ipynb** – Loops and iteration patterns

### 🧪 Libraries & Applied Topics

* **cheatsheet7_biopython.ipynb** – Introduction to Biopython: sequences, FASTA files, and basic parsing
* **cheatsheet8.ipynb** – Useful built-in functions and common Python patterns
* **cheatsheet9.ipynb** – Miscellaneous Python tips and reminders

> Notebook names may evolve as the repository becomes more structured.

## 📌 Notes

* This repository is **learning-oriented**, not production code
* Examples are intentionally short and focused
* Content may grow and be reorganized over time

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Renaming notebooks with numbered, topic-based names
* Adding short introductions at the top of each notebook
* Providing a condensed Markdown/PDF cheatsheet
* Expanding bioinformatics-related examples
